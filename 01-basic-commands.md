# Basic gcloud CLI Commands I've Mastered

## Goal: To master the gcloud CLI without a paid account, using only free resources like Cloud Shell.

### Authentication & Configuration
- `gcloud auth list` - Verified my authenticated account.
- `gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]` - Learned to set my active project.
- `gcloud config list` - Viewed all my current configuration settings.

### Getting Help (The Most Important Command)
- `gcloud --help` - Understand how to explore all available commands.
- `gcloud [COMMAND] --help` - Used this to learn specific commands like `gcloud run --help`.

### Exploring Services

This foundational knowledge is crucial for using the CLI effectively.
