# Simulating a Cloud Run Deployment

Although I cannot deploy without a billing account, I have mastered the exact process and command through research and practice in Cloud Shell.

## The Deployment Command I Am Prepared to Execute:

```bash
gcloud run deploy my-hello-service \
  --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/hello \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --platform=managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
