# 🚀 Mastering the GCloud CLI - A No-Cost Learning Journey

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am **Mayanja Charles**, a student and passionate learner from **Uganda**. Despite financial barriers that prevent access to a paid cloud account, I am determined to build my skills in cloud technology. This repository is my proof of concept and my preparation for the **Google CLI Research Study**.

## 🎯 My Challenge & Goal
**Challenge:** As a student without a international payment card, I cannot enable billing on GCP, blocking me from practical deployment.

**Goal:** To prove that passion, resourcefulness, and a desire to learn are the most important tools for a developer. I have focused on mastering the syntax, structure, and logic of the `gcloud` command-line interface using **only free resources** like Google's Cloud Shell.

## 📚 What I Have Learned & Demonstrated
This repository contains practical evidence of my learning:
- **CLI Proficiency:** Hands-on experience with `gcloud` configuration, help navigation, and service management.
- **Deployment Knowledge:** Deep understanding of the commands and workflow to deploy a service on Cloud Run.
- **Resourcefulness:** The ability to achieve learning goals without financial resources, using only what is freely available.

## 🔬 Why I Am an Ideal Candidate for the Google Study
I represent a large global audience of eager learners who face similar constraints. My feedback will be invaluable for making the GCP CLI more accessible, intuitive, and beginner-friendly for everyone, everywhere. My perspective is unique and necessary.

## 📁 How to Use This Repository
The Markdown files in this repository serve as a public, free learning guide for anyone else who wants to start their cloud journey with $0. They document a real, practical learning path.
